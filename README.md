# Blobs

A "sound toy" using Tone.js and HTML5 canvas. Circular 'blobs' bounce around in a box on screen in a basic particle simulation, making sounds whenever they hit the edges. The user can adjust the speed the blobs travel, and add and remove blobs.

This is an experiment to learn how to do animations with `<canvas>` in a React, and to learn more about using Tone.js to work with sound in the browser. I've been inspired by some of the awesome experiments in the [Chrome music lab](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/).

This is a work in progress! Once it's done I'll publish it on my website. Ideas for more sound toys welcome!
